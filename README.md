# Snake Game in Python

This Python script implements a simple console-based Snake Game.
Control the snake and try to eat the food to grow longer.

## Usage
- Run `snake_game.py` in your Python environment to start the game.
- Use arrow keys to control the snake (up, down, left, right).
- Eat the food to grow and avoid collisions with the walls and the snake itself.

Have fun playing the Snake Game!
